			It was 45 days ago that I took the liberty of becoming free. I set out with my
			laptop, ukulele and inline skates to cross state borders and to work with the
			music industry from anywhere in the world. Because technology gives us
			freedom.
		</p2>
		<h3>
			Places to visit before you die
		</h3>
		<p3>
			Many people want to travel the world and nearly everyone claims that
			„someday” they will actually do it. Truth is, most of us never make it past the
			pictures stored in our Pinterest folder named „Places to visit before you die”,
			because we are always looking for every reason for why this is not easy like
			that, why we could go later but not now… I was doing the same until I decided 
			to enrich my life with opportunities for making this wish a reality. And here I
			am, living my dream, going through the same Pinterest folder, only this time it’s
			titled “Places I will visit”. Not tomorrow. Today.
		</p3>
		<p3>
			I had planned this trip for more than a year. Constructively planning every
			other evening after work, I was slowly getting closer to my goal. Just as a book
			cannot be written in a day, a journey cannot be planned in a short timeframe. A
			great deal of time was spent on getting my own business up and running,
			establishing a stable clientele in Latvia and finding the right people to run the
			agency with. We’ve done a lot of experimenting and learning to work with
			freedom – that is, physically we can be anywhere in the world and still
			cooperate and work towards one goal, running our projects with the help of
			modern technology.

			There is this movie <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/">“Up In The Air”</a>, based on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30680.Up_in_the_Air">novel by Walter Kirn</a> about a
			man traveling all over the country with just a suitcase in his hand, living at
			airports and hotels and collecting the mileage he has flown. For quite some
			time now I have been dwelling on a quote from this movie, voiced by George
			Clooney (starring as Ryan Bingham).

			Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack. I want you to
			pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life... you start with the
			little things. The shelves, the drawers, the knickknacks, then you start
			adding larger stuff. Clothes, tabletop appliances, lamps, your TV... the				backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. You go bigger. Your<br>
			couch, your car, your home... I want you to stuff it all into that
			backpack.
			Try to walk.
			Now I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances,
			friends of friends, folks around the office... and then you move into
			the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Your brothers,
			your sisters, your children, your parents and finally your husband,
			your wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend. You get them into that
			backpack, feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake your
			relationships are the heaviest components in your life. All those
			negotiations and arguments and secrets, the compromises. The
			slower we move the faster we die. Make no mistake, moving is living.
			Some animals were meant to carry each other to live symbiotically
			over a lifetime. Star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not
			swans. We are sharks.

			/George Clooney (Ryan Bingham), Up In The Air/
		</div>
		<p3>
			Whenever I’m moving between various lines in my life – because life consists of
			several diverse cycles – I always find it useful to ask myself: “What’s in my
			backpack?”. Most often this question crawls up to your conscious at the
			luggage scale in airports, and sometimes the bagstraps over your shoulders
			suddenly feel too tight for comfort… Those are all the things that you don’t
			need, namely, unneeded knickknacks, people, addictions, desires, habits, traits,
			fears, deadlines, unfulfillable promises, goals and dreams that are not yours…
		</p3>
		<h4>
			The “Freedom Backpack” is my mantra for a more happy and simple way of life
		</h4>
		<p7>
			Before leaving for the airport, I took everything out of my bag and the started
			putting everything back, one item at a time.<br>
			I started with the easiest - stuff.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Clothes
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I put back only those pieces of clothing, which allow for comfort, leaving out
			the ones, which just give the looks - they only weigh down your bag. We spend
			so much time on thinking what we’ll put on for a business meeting, a BBQ
			party or a date. At the end of the day all this socializing becomes a burden,
			because 90% of the attention is devoted to ourselves – we keep on thinking
			along the lines of „Does this shirt really look good on me?” or „Do I look good
			enough?” instead of just meeting up and enjoying the moment of being
			together.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Ukulele
		</h5>
		<p7>
			Taking an electric guitar along with all the accessories would be too much of a
			luxury, so I decided to take up the „small guitar” – the ukulele! I went for the
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kalabrand.com/Models/Kala/Travel/DetailsPageTravelUke.html">“Kala Thinline travel ukulele”</a>, an instrument specially designed for travelers,
			featuring a thinner body and… an inbuilt compass. 
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Inline skates
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I began inline skating just half a year ago… I had never skated before. One
			night, however, I had a dream about freedom, where I breezed through the
			nightly streets of the city, and – first thing in the morning – I went straight to a
			skate shop and got my first pair of inliners. My friends couldn’t wrap their
			heads around as to how I got this idea, but I knew from the very beginning –
			this was my sport and I would do well at it, because I had already made my
			choice. And it is a fun sport indeed! I have already learned some valuable
			lessons about the city’s architecture and the balance between body and mind. 
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Camera
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I won’t take a classic photo camera, because I won’t be keeping an eye out for
			every beautiful moment or scene. When I think about hauling a big reflex
			camera with me all the time, setting up the best shooting mode and waiting for
			the right moment, I soon realize it would only take away from enjoying the
			moment. Life is about seeing and experiencing, not capturing on film, though I
			have to admit – listing through photos after a trip is just great. So I chose to
			take a stunning little invention – the <a target="_blank" href="http://getnarrative.com/">“Narrative Clip” camera</a> – a tiny 3x3 cm
			camera that snaps a shot every 30 seconds. I keep it clipped to my bagstrap. At
			the end of the day all pics are uploaded to a cloud server and an app and, what
			is more, I’ve truly enjoyed all the captured moments without ever trying to
			capture them. These photos tell a living and true story, because all the
			moments are genuinely true, unstaged and natural.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Data
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I upload all my files to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> cloud service. That way I don’t have to carry
			around any GB, yet everything is instantly accessible from anywhere and with
			any device.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Books
		</h5>
		<p7>
			My 7 mm-thin tablet can take in all my bookshelf and still has room enough for the world’s
			biggest library with 40 million units. In other words – I am subscribed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Music
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I am subscribed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a>, so I don’t have to carry all my music collection with
			me. Believe me – it’s bigger than yours. Music is everywhere: on my laptop
			when I’m working, on my iPod when I’m skating. Rdio music stream is a true
			musical freedom revolution.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Habits
		</h5>
		<p7>
			The next and the hardest part – addictions, desires, habits and traits. I am
			taking all of them with me, as one cannot escape or hide from these things,
			only try to. And I think this is one of the most common mistakes by travelers –
			to seek to escape their own past with the excuse of „searching for their inner
			self”.<br>
			I have taken it upon myself to lose this weight along the way and come home
			with a lighter bag than I left with. For instance – thank my sanity – it’s been half
			a year since I gave up smoking. For a passionate smoker, giving up the
			cigarette means dropping a huge weight off his shoulders and regaining
			freedom, which was taken by the nicotine in the bloodstream.
		</p7>
		<h5>
			Work
		</h5>
		<p7>
			I am taking my relationships with my clients and colleagues with me. All my
			projects and deadlines. I have pledged to myself that I will lose even more fear
			and stress.<br>
			I want to drop the small jobs and devote all my time and energy to big projects.
			I want to do something that holds some real meaning and value, that would
			leave an imprint in the sands of time.
		</p7>
		<h4>
			Riga - Tallinn - Venice - Brighton - Paris - Keflavík - Groningen - Tallinn - Riga
		</h4>
		<p7>
			During my trip I have decided to live in several countries, moving to a different
			city every 8 to 12 weeks. My trip will begin and end with the Tallinn Music Week
			showcase festival and conference. I already know I’ll fall in love with Venice,
			playing my ukulele in the warm summer nights at the Grand Canal. I’ll try out the
			rides at Brighton Pier and visit The Great Escape Showcase festival and
			conference. In Paris, I’ll breathe freedom, sweeping through the evidence of
			magnificent architecture on my inliners, and visit the MaMa festival and
			convention. Once I get to Iceland, I’ll switch off my internet access, live in the
			mountains and swim in the blue lagoon. And I intend to visit the Eurosonic
			showcase festival and conference in Groningen. However, I do reserve the right
			to change my trip plan and make some spontaneous moves, for I have the
			freedom to do so.

		<h6>
			Our living space is not the m2 we rent – it’s the world
		</h6>
		<p7>
			Before my trip, while living in Latvia, I had moved 5 times and lived in 3 cities.
			Each occasion of moving helped me get rid of unneeded stuff and people in my
			life. For the last year I had a unique experience with trying to live in a 4 m2
			room. Most people become claustrophobic or just feel uncomfortable in a
			small space, because the world suddenly seems too confined as they are forced
			to be so close to themselves. At first I too thought this is the ultimate horror,
			but during one year of living in this err… room I learned two important lessons
			about spaciousness:
		</p7>
		<p7>
			Firstly, we own the whole world, not just the living space we rent. Even the
			most spacious penthouse apartment is nothing compared to the space of our
			world.<br>
		</p7>
		<p7>
			Secondly, it’s not the world, which is providing space, but our own inner space,
			when we’re alone, even in a very loud or cramped environment. It’s the peace
			of our mind. That’s freedom. So, no matter where I am, I’ll be calm, creative and
			happy, because, with the breath of our universe soughing through me, I shall
			have my inner space grow ever vaster.
		</p7>
		<p7>
			I can’t tell, where I’ll decide to settle down in the long term, but I already know
			it will be a small, cozy apartment of a smart and practical design of my own. I
			am sure that by then I’ll have learned to organize my life even better. Lately I’ve
			been hearing about more and more people choosing to live smaller, but
			smarter and more consciously. I am fascinated by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thetinylife.com/">tiny house movement</a> –
			for instance, San Francisco architects are already designing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.panoramic.com/smartspace./">smartspace
			apartment buildings</a> in full swing.
		</p7>
		<h7>
			No Travel Blog, OK?
		</h7>
		<p7>
			I have not undertaken this adventure to tick off countries and cities where I’ve
			been or to report my every move in tweets and shallow vintage-filter-processed
			pics on Instagram. I won’t be keeping a travel blog, because the thought of
			coming up with the next blog post would compromise my freedom to enjoy my
			time (I shall leave this to the other 100,000 travel blogs out there). I will just
			post an update on my Facebook timeline every now and then, letting people
			know what shows I’m planning to attend, what places we can meet up, as well
			as „Life events” with the cities I’m moving over to live and work in. And… there’s
			going to be more into the story.
		</p7>
		<h6>
			Who am I, anyway?
		</h6>
		<p7>
			My name is Jānis Vērzemnieks. I’m from Latvia (A country in Europe. Just in
			case). I’m a 23-year old music fan, graphic designer and an
			entrepreneur-freshman in music industry. To gain my financial and creative
			freedom, I started out as a freelance designer. Now I have already founded a
			design studio and music marketing agency named <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jveart.com/">JVeart</a>, though we feel more
			like a rock-band playing alternative advertising rock, design’n’code and
			branding pop. We recently issued our debut portfolio album and I am excited
			about handing a copy to the industry-people I’ll meet along the way. We’re also
			writing our second portfolio album, which is due to be out in 2015, when I’ll
			return to Latvia.
